# Zero2Prod: Mailing List

This is my implementation of the Mailing List project of the Zero to Production book by Luca Palmieri.

The project objective is to showcase various themes of software engineering for backend services using the Rust language and the Actix HTTP framework with its crates ecosystem.

The topics are:
1. Test-driven development using integration and unit testing.
2. Type-driven development for data sanitization.
3. Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions.
4. Code instrumentation.
5. Containerization and Deployment with Docker and Digital Ocean.
